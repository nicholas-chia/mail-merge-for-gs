# Mail Merge for GS
This is a Google Sheets Add On written in Google Apps Script for simple mail merge function.
## How to use?
### Method 1
1. Install this Add On in a new Google Sheet
2. Run "Initialise Template" - this would create a "Template" worksheet for the recipient list.
3. Run "Initialise Configurations" - this would create a "Configuration" worksheet required to successful run a mail merge operation.
4. (Optional) Download the email banner to your Google Drive. Get the File Link. Modify to your needs.
5. Download the email html template to your Google Drive. Get the File Link. Modify to your needs.
6. Modify the template and configurations worksheet according to your setup.
7. Run "Notify By Email" to send emails.

See below sections for details about a template worksheet and configuration worksheet. I have also provided the sample files for banner, template and attachment.

### Method 2
If you organisation does not allow you to install Add Ons, you can deploy and use this script by copying it to a local Google Apps Script project and deploy as an Add On for your own use.

## Configurations
You must have this work sheet before running the mail merge function. Running this function will create a configuration each time. Rename the previously created configuration before running this function as it will remove and recreate a new "Configuration" worksheet each time.
